        - name: About JSON
          value: |
            `JSON` is expanded as `JavaScript Object Notation`
            [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) a [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) language
            It is commonly used to convert an `object` such as an `array` (`list` in python), `map` (`dict` in python) and strings into a plaintext format.
            This is done in order to transfer data from one language to other. Say you have a python dict, you can convert it to JSON and read it as a JavaScript object.
            Over the web everything can only be transferred as plaintext, hence JSON was standardized as the format to be used to do so.
